List of Libraries: numPy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib

SVM Manual:
To train your SVM classifier, we need to use our training dataset. The training dataset is
already called in the training.py file, so to train your SVM classifier you just have to run
training.trainSVM(), and you will recieve the theta values of your SVM classifier. Taking in the
whole dataset it makes a linear classifier determining whether your credit card will be approved 
or not.

To test your SVM classifier, you do the samething, except using testing.py, and testing.trainSVM()not.

ROC Manual:
To get the ROC curve as well as the AUC score you run runROC.run(), and import runROC. 

K-Folds Cross Validation:

To cross validate our data we used K-Folds cross validation. The value we used for k was 50. To run the technique on your training data, you need 
to access training.py. Within training.py there is a method called trainkFolds. You run training.trainkFolds() to
cross validate your data. Using a probablistic predictor it will analyze the skill of data.

Decision Tree:

Our decision has multiple different functions, one to build the tree, entropy, info gain etc. In our decisionTree.py file, you can see how we build
the tree, train it, and test to find a bad customer.
